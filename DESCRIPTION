Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Antoine",
           family = "Fabri",

Description: 'flow_view' and its sister functions allow an intuitive overview of
  functions or scripts by displaying them as flow diagrams. We also provide a 
  debugging utility: 'flow_run', which displays the logical path taken
  by a function call, and supports step by step browsing.
